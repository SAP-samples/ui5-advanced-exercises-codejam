SAP CodeJam - Advanced UI5

This SAP CodeJam introduces you to more advanced topics and techniques around UI5, such as TypeScript, a monorepository setup (incl. CAP server), OData V4 caveats, consuming third party packages, creating your own UI5 controls and libraries, and testing. You can look forward to a full day of learning, interesting discussions, and plenty of time for hacking. You will have the best learning experience if you have previously built UI5 application and already have a good understanding of its basic concepts.

The event will be run by Peter Muessig (Chief Development Architect) and Nico Schoenteich (Developer Advocate).
